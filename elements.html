<h2>Professional Objectives</h2>
<br>
<li>Trained as a mathematician in university, I discovered my passion for big data and machine learning algorithms after graduating. 
After a few years of self-learning I decided to pursue my MSc in Data Science and am now seeking a challenging position fully 
utilizing my skills in data science, data visualization and machine learning.</li>
<br>

<h2>Technology Expertise</h2>
<li>Expertise using <b>Python</b> (<i>Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Dash, Seaborn, GeoPandas, SciPy and NumPy</i>), <b>R</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>MATLAB</b> and <b>Microsoft Office</b>.</li>
<li>Experience with <b>Google</b> <b>Cloud Platform</b>, <b>Azure</b>, <b>AWS</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>HTML</b> and <b>Java</b>.</li>
<li>Knowledge of Git Control, Scrum, Unix commands and distributed computing.</li>
<br>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danielbsimpson/Covid-19-tracking-USA">Covid tracking dash app</a>
<br>
Working with my old advisor, I designed a web app to track covid-19 within the United States on a county level. 
The Johns Hopkins repository was used for collecting the covid-19 data and was used in the calculations of the R-rate estimate of the virus. 
Pandas was used for collecting and cleaning the data, R-rate calculations were generated using the EpiEstim library within R, 
the dashboard was built using the dash and plotly libraries, and the website was hosted using Google Cloud Platform.
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="https://github.com/danielbsimpson/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone">K-means Clustering for Business Investments</a>
<br>
I implemented the k-means clustering algorithm on demographic and income data, identifying similar boroughs within London. 
Once the clusters had been established each borough was compared to the cluster it fell within, identifying potential business venue opportunities. 
Demographic data was web scraped using BeautifulSoup and pandas, Scikit-learn was utilized for k-means, 
venue data was collected using the FourSquare API, and visuals were generated using matplotlib and folium libraries.
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="https://github.com/danielbsimpson/Mask-Recognition-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning">CNNs for face mask detection</a>
<br>
I designed and trained multiple convolutional neural networks to be able to identify whether individuals in an image were wearing a face mask or not. 
Transfer learning was applied to the second CNN to demonstrate the usefulness of utilizing pre-trained models. 
Keras was used to build the models and matplotlib was used to visual the results.
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dbsimpson/us-wages">Visualizing wages in the United States</a>
<br>
I built interactive visuals using data taken from the federal reserve bank of New York. 
Effects of the dot com boom, 2008 financial crisis, and covid-19 pandemic are all visualized and analyzed for their effect on the job market. 
Pandas and plotly were used for data analysis and visualization.
</li>
<br>
