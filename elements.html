<br>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danielbsimpson/Covid-19-tracking-USA">Covid tracking dash app</a>
<br>
<p>
Working with my old advisor, I designed a web app to track covid-19 within the United States on a county level. 
The Johns Hopkins repository was used for collecting the covid-19 data and was used in the calculations of the R-rate estimate of the virus. 
Pandas was used for collecting and cleaning the data, R-rate calculations were generated using the EpiEstim library within R, 
the dashboard was built using the dash and plotly libraries, and the website was hosted using Google Cloud Platform.
</p>
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="https://github.com/danielbsimpson/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone">K-means Clustering for Business Investments</a>
<br>
<p>
I implemented the k-means clustering algorithm on demographic and income data, identifying similar boroughs within London. 
Once the clusters had been established each borough was compared to the cluster it fell within, identifying potential business venue opportunities. 
Demographic data was web scraped using BeautifulSoup and pandas, Scikit-learn was utilized for k-means, 
venue data was collected using the FourSquare API, and visuals were generated using matplotlib and folium libraries.
</p>
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="https://github.com/danielbsimpson/Facial-recognition-and-Mask-Identification">Facial recognition and mask detection</a>
<br>
<p>
This project takes in an image, identifies individual faces in the image, and feeds a cropped image of just the 
face into a CNN to identify whether the individual is wearing a mask or not. CV2 is utilized for facial 
recognition, while Keras and ImageNet are used to build the CNN for mask identification.
</p>
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="https://github.com/danielbsimpson/Mask-Recognition-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning">CNNs for face mask detection</a>
<br>
<p>
I designed and trained multiple convolutional neural networks to be able to identify whether individuals in an image were wearing a face mask or not. 
Transfer learning was applied to the second CNN to demonstrate the usefulness of utilizing pre-trained models. 
Keras was used to build the models and matplotlib was used to visual the results.
</p>
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dbsimpson/us-wages">Visualizing wages in the United States</a>
<br>
<p>
I built interactive visuals using data taken from the federal reserve bank of New York. 
Effects of the dot com boom, 2008 financial crisis, and covid-19 pandemic are all visualized and analyzed for their effect on the job market. 
Pandas and plotly were used for data analysis and visualization.
</p>
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dbsimpson/multiple-models-for-titanic-data-set">Multiple models on Titanic Dataset</a>
<br>
<p>
A Kaggle Notebook using Python, I apply multiple machine learning algorithms to model surival of passengers on the Titanic Dataset. 
Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, XGBoost, and Neural Networks 
are all applied. Sci-kit learn and keras are the libraries that I used for this project. 
k-fold cross Validation is used to access each models performance.
</p>
</li>
<br>

<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dbsimpson/exploring-san-francisco-housing-with-plotly">Analysis on San Fransisco Housing</a>
<br>
<p>
Using the plotly library, visuals are created to understand the rising cost of housing in the bay area. 
Data was collected from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The house price index, workers index, rent index, 
income index, and consumer price index were all utilized.
The final part of the notebook uses Facebook's Prophet to make a prediction on the cost of housing in the coming years.
</p>
</li>
<br>

Exploring the various variables and predictors for MPG, I design plots with linear regression models, 
along with confidence and prediction intervals.

</li>
<br>

<li><a href="https://github.com/danielbsimpson/HClustering_USArrests">H-Clustering with USArrests Dataset in R</a>
<br>
<p>
Using the USArrests dataset in R, I use Heirarchical Clustering and plot the results using a dendogram visaulization. 
The file is written as an R markdown file, and utilizes the datasets and cluster libraries.
</p>
