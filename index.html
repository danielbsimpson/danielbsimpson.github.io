										<h3><a href="https://github.com/danielbsimpson/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone" class="link">Clustering for Business Investments in London</a></h3>
										<p>Used the k-means clustering algorithm on demographic and income data, identifying similar boroughs within London. 
										Once the clusters had been established each borough was compared to the cluster it fell within, identifying potential 
										business venue opportunities. Demographic data was web scraped using BeautifulSoup and pandas, 
										Scikit-learn was utilized for k-means, venue data was collected using the FourSquare API, and visuals were 
										generated using matplotlib and folium libraries. </p>

										<p>Utilizing the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 data repository, I designed a dashboard to track cases and deaths in the United States
											on a national and local level. Data was sourced and cleaned using the Pandas library in Python, while R-rate was calculated using
											the EpiEstim library in R studio. The webpage was built with Dash, graphics were built with Plotly, and the web app was deployed 
											and is hosted using Google Cloud Platform. It is hosted on the east coast of the United States so please allow for a few seconds for it
											to load.</p>

										<h3><a href="https://github.com/danielbsimpson/Anomaly-Detection" class="link">Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning</a></h3>
										<p>This project was designed to explore the applications of machine learning for anomaly detection, using unsupervised and supervised techniques. For the unsupervised
										part of the project, 4 data sets from Numenta Anomaly Benchmark are used, applying k-means, Gaussian distribution, isolation forests, SVM, and LSTM neural networks.
										For the supervised portion of this project a credit card dataset is used and multiple models are built and tested. The best performing model was then tuned using a grid
										search algorithm.</p>
