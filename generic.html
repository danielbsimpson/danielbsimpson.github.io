										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Honeymoon_img.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>I am a Data Scientist and programmer with an interest in Data Visualization and Machine Learning. I was first introduced into programming in high school where I learned basic C++.
										Later in university I became familiar with basic JavaScript and Matlab.
										Primarily my background	is in mathematical and statistical analysis, obtaining my BSc in Mathematics from West Virginia University.
										While in University I was able to help as a research assistant in a flowcytometry lab where I first experienced big data analytics using Microsoft Excel.</p>
									<p>After University I spent over 5 years teaching primary and secondary education in the United States and abroad. During that period I self learned basic R and Python programming skills. I improved upon my skills by taking various
									courses online related to Data Science through Coursera and DataCamp.</p>
									<p>Eventually I decided to pursue my MSc in Data Science and started attending Birkbeck, University of London where I graduated
										in September 2020. My focus has been on Python, SQL, R, Java, neural networks, dimensionality reduction, network theory, optimization techniques, and cloud computing.
										I especially enjoy using the Python libraries pandas, matplotlib, plotly, keras, and scikit-learn. My side projects tend to utilize these libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
										My MSc project is focused on LSTM neural networks on financial data and optimization through the use of evolutionary algorithms.</p>
									<p>I love to travel all over the world. I've visited Canada, Thailand, India, Palestine, Israel, France, Italy, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Turkey, Costa Rica, and England.
									Coming from the mountain state of West Virginia where I was raised,
									I've lived in Virginia, and later moved to Thailand to teach mathematics and science to bilingual students. I now live in London, England with my wonderful wife where we are
									both furthering our educational journey. </p>
									<p> Besides programming and traveling I have always enjoyed investing, video games, weightlifting, exercise, sports, muay thai, boxing, mixed martial arts, science fiction, fantasy, cooking, and reading.
									If you share any of these interests or ever need help working with data, please feel free to contact me!</p>
