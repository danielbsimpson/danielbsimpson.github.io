										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Honeymoon_img.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>I’m a Data Scientist living in the Greater Boston area after previously living in London, Washington DC, and Thailand. 
										My journey into data started during my undergraduate years at West Virginia University, where I earned a BSc in Mathematics and worked part-time as a research assistant in a medical lab. 
										There, I helped analyze large datasets from flow cytometry machines, which gave me my first exposure to big data and sparked my interest in analytics.</p>
									<p>After graduating, I spent four years teaching mathematics and statistics—primarily at the high school level—along with science in both primary and secondary schools in the U.S. and abroad. 
										During this time, I began self-learning programming and data science, which ultimately led me to pursue an MSc in Data Science at Birkbeck, University of London.</p>
									<p>Following my MSc, I entered the corporate world, initially focusing on upskilling data analysts and guiding them in building advanced machine learning and data science projects. 
										After nearly two years, I transitioned into a hands-on role developing these solutions myself, specializing in customer analytics within retail.</p>
									<p>Today, I work at TJX Companies Inc. on the Consumer Business & Insights team within the Marketing Department. 
										My work includes building predictive models and automation tools that save time and money, as well as integrating machine learning into marketing strategies to improve ROI on digital ad spend. 
										I’ve also worked on incorporating large language models into data pipelines and dashboards to extract insights from unstructured data, enabling smarter decision-making.</p>
									<p> My technical expertise spans Python, R, SQL, and cloud platforms, with experience in Databricks, Snowflake Cortex, Streamlit, and Power BI. 
										I’ve developed strong skills in data engineering and ML DevOps, creating scalable, production-ready solutions that drive measurable business impact.</p>
									<p>
										Outside of work, I’m passionate about travel and exploring new cultures. 
										Raised in the mountain state of West Virginia, I’ve lived in Virginia and spent time in Thailand teaching mathematics and science to bilingual students. 
										Over the years, I’ve visited Canada, Thailand, India, Palestine, Israel, France, Monaco, Spain, Italy, Malta, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt, Costa Rica, the Netherlands, Scotland, and England. 
										These experiences have shaped my perspective and fueled my curiosity about the world. 
										Beyond travel, I enjoy financial investing, weightlifting, martial arts, muay thai, cooking, rock climbing, hiking, photography, dungeons & dragons, and discovering new technologies.
